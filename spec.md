# Cabinet Visualization PoC - Technical Specification

## Project Overview
A proof-of-concept web application that allows woodworkers to configure basic cabinet parameters through a user interface and visualize the result as a 3D rendered model.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Configuration UI
- **Input Method**: Web-based user interface
- **UI Style**: Simple, scalable design that can be extended with additional features
- **Target Item**: Basic rectangular cabinet

### 2. Configurable Parameters
- **Overall Dimensions**:
  - Width (inches)
  - Depth (inches) 
  - Height (inches)
  - Format: "24 inches wide by 36 inches deep by 30 inches tall"
- **Wood Type**: Dropdown selection supporting:
  - Common hardwoods (oak, maple, cherry, walnut, etc.)
  - Softwoods (pine, fir, cedar, etc.)
  - Engineered materials (plywood, MDF)
- **Number of Shelves**: Configurable count (including fixed shelves)

### 3. 3D Rendering Requirements
- **Visual Style**: Simple solid colors representing different wood types (no complex textures/grain for PoC)
- **Assembly View**: Show cabinet as a complete, assembled piece
- **Wood Grain Orientation**: Apply standard woodworking practices automatically
- **Rendering Technology**: 3D web-based rendering engine

### 4. 3D Interaction Controls
- **Rotation**: Click and drag to rotate view
- **Zoom**: Zoom in/out functionality
- **Multiple Angles**: Ability to view from different perspectives
- **Default View**: Start with a standard 3/4 perspective view

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Principles
- **Scalability**: Design system to easily accommodate future features
- **Modularity**: Separate UI configuration from 3D rendering logic
- **Extensibility**: Structure allows for adding new furniture types and parameters

### Component Breakdown
1. **Configuration Panel**: Input controls for cabinet parameters
2. **3D Viewer**: Rendering area with interaction controls
3. **Data Layer**: Convert UI inputs to 3D model specifications
4. **Rendering Engine**: Generate and display 3D cabinet model

### Wood Type Rendering
- Use distinct solid colors for different wood species
- Maintain consistent color mapping across sessions
- Consider standard wood color associations (oak = light brown, walnut = dark brown, etc.)

## User Workflow
1. User opens application
2. Selects wood type from dropdown
3. Enters cabinet dimensions in width × depth × height format
4. Specifies number of internal shelves
5. 3D model generates automatically based on inputs
6. User can rotate, zoom, and inspect the rendered cabinet
7. Changes to parameters update the 3D model in real-time

## Future Expansion Considerations
- Additional furniture types (tables, chairs, etc.)
- More detailed wood grain textures
- Advanced joinery visualization
- Multiple viewing modes (exploded view, wireframe)
- Export capabilities
- Measurement tools
- Material quantity calculations

## Success Criteria for PoC
- Successfully configure basic cabinet parameters through UI
- Generate accurate 3D model based on inputs
- Smooth 3D interaction controls (rotate, zoom, pan)
- Clean, intuitive user interface
- Real-time updates when parameters change
- Scalable codebase ready for feature additions

## Technical Stack Recommendations
- **Frontend**: Modern web framework with 3D capabilities
- **3D Rendering**: WebGL-based solution (Three.js recommended)
- **UI Framework**: Component-based system for scalability
- **State Management**: Reactive system for real-time updates
